</html>
<p> Hello! My name is Sharon. I am from Pawtucket, Rhode Island. I have an older brother that graduated from URI this year. My hobbies are reading, cooking and baking. I have one pet, a tiny kitten named Nina who is 4 months old.</p>

<p>My major is Accounting which I have been studying since high school 4 years ago. I am from Nigeria and I have been in the US for 5 years. I am also trilingual and I speak English, Yoruba (my native language) and Italian.</p>

<p>My goal for this course is to learn the basics of a programming language and to develop skills in writing, debugging, and testing simple programs.</p>
